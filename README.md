# Introduction

 I'm organizing a study group for the book "Code Complete" by Steve Mcconnell. The group is composed of people how has some experience programming and they want to jump to the next level.

 I read this book a couple of years after I was working in the industry and it change my way of how I approach software development.
 However, if you don't have that much experience in the field is possible you won't be able to appreciate it as much.

 So I would like to try something different. I want to select a couple of topics of the book every week and do some practical exercise to make it more fun.

## Methodology

 Every week we will select some chapter of the book and give some problem to resolve. Ideally, every problem should be solved in at least two programming languages. We would like to get some experience in Python, Swift, and Java.
